def distance_sphere(p1, p2, units='km'):
    ''' distance_sphere() - Uses the Haversine formula to calculate the
        distance between two (lat,lon) points on a sphere.
        p1 = [lat1,lon1], p2 = [lat2,lon2] in degrees
        units = 'km' (default), 'mi' for miles, or 'ft' for feet

    Parameters
    ----------
    p1 : list
        lat, lon coordinates of a point in degrees

    p2 : list
        lat, lon coordinates of a point in degrees

    units : str, default='km'
        distance units: 'km','mi' or 'ft'

    Returns
    -------
    distance : float
        distance between p1 and p2

    '''
