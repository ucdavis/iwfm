def bearing(p1, p2):
    ''' bearing() - Return the bearing between two (lat,lon) points
        p1 = [lat1,lon1], p2 = [lat2,lon2] in degrees
        Description of algorithm at https://www.mathsisfun.com/sine-cosine-tangent.html
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    p1 : list
        point coordinates as floats [latitude,longitude]

    p2 : list
        point coordinates as floats [latitude,longitude]

    Returns
    -------
    bearing : float
        angle between p1 and p2
