    ''' skip_ahead() - Increment line_index by skipping (a) every line that
        begins with 'C', 'c' '*' or '#' and (b) 'skip' additional lines.
        Stop if last line (all_lines) is reached

    Parameters
    ----------
    line_index : int
        current line number

    all_lines : list
        each item is one line from a file

    skip : int, default=0
        number of non-comment lines to skip

    Returns
    -------
    line_index : int
        new current line or -1 if end reached

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If line_index is negative or skip is negative
    TypeError
        If all_lines is not a list or line_index/skip are not integers
