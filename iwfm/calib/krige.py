    Parameters
    ----------
    A : list
        List of tuples representing grid A points. Each tuple contains (id, x, y) coordinates.
    
    B : list
        List of tuples representing grid B points. Each tuple contains (id, x, y, value) coordinates.
    
    Returns
    -------
    kriging_factors : list
        List of lists containing kriging factor floats for spatial interpolation.
