def ftp_fetch(server, dir, filename='download.txt', verbose=False):
    ''' ftp_fetch() - Download a file from a server and save to
        the specified directory and file name

    This function uses anonymous FTP login to access the server.
    Anonymous FTP allows public access without requiring a username
    or password. The connection is made using the 'anonymous' username
    with an empty password (or optionally an email address as password).

    Parameters
    ----------
    server : str
        URL or INET address of FTP server (must support anonymous access)

    dir : str
        Download directory name on the FTP server

    filename : str, default='download.txt'
        Download file name (same name used on server and locally)

    verbose : bool, default=False
        True = command-line output on

    Returns
    -------
    None
        File is saved to the current working directory

    Raises
    ------
    ConnectionError
        If unable to connect to FTP server
    PermissionError
        If anonymous login is denied
    FileNotFoundError
        If directory or file not found on server
    IOError
        If unable to write file locally

    Notes
    -----
    Anonymous FTP Login:
    - Uses username: 'anonymous' (implicit in ftplib.FTP.login())
    - Uses password: '' (empty) or email address
    - Requires server to allow anonymous access
    - Common for public data repositories and archives
